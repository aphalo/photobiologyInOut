Add support for StellarNet spectrometers and Bentham spectrometers.
Add a generic reader of files into a collection of spectra.
Add alternative reader of TUV output files into a collection of spectra.
Add support for libRadTran output files.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.4.1
===========================

Update vignette. Fix docs.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.4.0
===========================

This is a major update, not backwards compatible, as names and formal 
parameters of all functions have changed. Trimming is no longer supported
(should be done as a separate operation).

The functions for Ocean Optics files now read the number of pixels from the
file header, and hopefully will better adjust to different instruments and 
settings.

Functions for reading multiple spectra now return collections of spectra.
(Functions that saved the spectral objects constructed from the data read 
from text files on disk back to disk as R dara files have been removed.)

New functions for reading daily spectral exposure data from files returned
by models from FMI have been added.

New function for reading ,csv file from Avantes' AvaSpec spectrometers added.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.3.2
===========================

Add "use.hinges" argument to functions, and default to not adding hinges when
trimming input.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.3.1
===========================

Remove dependency on data.table.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.3.0
===========================

Corrected some bugs in read_licor_files()

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.2.1
===========================

Added function to read spectral irradiance files geenrated by the Jaz spectrometer
from Ocean Optics.

Functions names shortened.

Expanded the User Guide.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.2.0
===========================

Edited read_licor_prn_files() drastically. The new version is functionally 
equivalent but formal arguments have changed. In addtion it is now implemented 
by calling read_licor_prn_file().

New functions read_licor_prn_file(), read_macam_dta_file(), 
read_ooss_txt_file() and read_tuv_file() returning source.spct objects.

Function read_xlsx() removed as there are other packages available for Excel
file import.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.1.3
===========================

Added function read.xlsx() for reading data from Excel workbook files saved 
as .xlsx (zipped XML format). 

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.1.2
===========================

Added parameter unit.out and cleaned code.

photobiologyInOut Ver 0.1.0
===========================

First version containing only one function for importing data measured with 
a LI-COR LI-1800 spectroradiometer from .PRN text files produced by the 
PC1800 MS-DOS program from LI-COR.
