#' @section Warning!: 
#' Most of the file formats supported are not standardized, and are a moving
#' target because of changes in instrument firmware and support software. In
#' addition the output format, especially with models, can depend on settings
#' that users can alter. So do check that import is working as expected, and
#' if not, please please raise a bug or support ticket and upload one 
#' example of an incorrectly decoded file.
#' 
#' @note Paths need to end in a (forward) slash, even under Windows. Under Windows
#' you may need to install Unix/Linux style command line utilities for this
#' function to work. For example install the RTools corresponding to the R
#' version you are using. Under OS X or Linux, all needed uitlities are part of
#' the operating system.
