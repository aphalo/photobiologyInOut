# README for phootbiologyInOut #

`photobiologyInOut` is an R package providing functions for importing spectral data from instrument-specific files. It complements other packages in the  R suite for _photobiology_.

A function for importing the output generated by the TUV simulation program is included.

This package is at an early stage of development, and I have only a limited sample of output files. The functions may not work with different software or firmware versions used for generating spectral data.

Please, see the web site [R4Photobiology](http://www.r4photobiology.info) for details on other packages available as part of the suite, and on how to install them.

_The functions in this package work with the example files I have used for testing, but they may not work with your own files as file formats may vary._

__PLEASE, BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN USING THIS PACKAGE. DO CHECK THAT UNITS USED IN THE IMPORTED FILE ARE THOSE EXPECTED BY THESE FUNCTIONS AND THAT THE VALUES ARE AS EXPECTED!__
