# README for phootbiologyInOut #

`photobiologyInOut` is an R package providing functions for importing spectral data from instrument-specific files. It complements other packages in the  R suite for _photobiology_.

A function for importing the output generated by the TUV simulation program is included.

This package is at an early stage of development, and I have only a limited sample of output files. The functions may not work with different software or firmware versions used for generating spectral data.

__PLEASE, BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN CHECKING THAT UNITS USED IN THE IMPORTED FILE ARE THOSE EXPECTED BY THESE FUNCTIONS!__
